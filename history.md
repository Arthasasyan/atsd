# History

ATSD is developed by [Axibase Corporation](https://axibase.com/about-us/), a privately owned company established in 2004 and headquartered in Cupertino, CA, USA.

We have decade-long experience with infrastructure management systems, big data, and analytics. With ATSD, we aim to build a specialized database with a focus on data quality and performance where time-series data is treated as a first-class citizen.
