# Enabling Swap Space

## Overview

Linux divides its physical memory (RAM) into blocks of memory called pages. Swapping is the process when a page of memory is copied to the allocated hard drive space, called swap space, in order to free up RAM. The combined size of physical memory and swap space is the amount of virtual memory available.

## Swap Size

For production servers, set swap to 50% of the physical memory.

For testing systems, set swap to 100% of the physical memory.

Check available memory:

```sh
free
```

```ls
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1922136    1274196     647940         32      92508     315664
-/+ buffers/cache:     866024    1056112
Swap:      2064380      31016    2033364
```

## Enabling Swap

The following instructions describe how to create swap without restarting the server.

Create 1GB swap file (`1024000 * 1024`). Increase `count=` as appropriate.

```sh
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024000
```

Configure the swap file.

```sh
sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile
```

```sh
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

Enable swap.

```sh
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

Enable swap on boot.

```sh
sudo echo "/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

Verify that the swap is enabled.

```sh
free
```

The output should contain a row with Swap total not equal to zero.

```ls
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       7697000    6104904    1592096         32      86628    3062424
-/+ buffers/cache:    2955852    4741148
Swap:      1023996          0    1023996
```
